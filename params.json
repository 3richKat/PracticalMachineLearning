This is a good fit because it does not require scaling our parameters, and can accomodate a large number of features.  Though computationally expensive, we have trimmed our features enough in the previous step to allow this model to run on a normal laptop.  \r\n```{r}\r\nrfmodel <- randomForest(x=train.sub[,8:59], y=train.sub$classe )\r\nrfmodel\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Random Forest performs extrememly well, with an Out of Sample error rate of less than 1% (0.28%).  Given the nature of the Random Forest Alogrithm, cross validation is included in the error rate.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's predict the classifaction of the test set.  \r\n```{r}\r\nrftest <- predict(rfmodel, test.sub[8:59])\r\npaste(rftest)\r\n```\r\nLooks like we predicted all 20 correctly!!\r\n\r\nBelow is a plot showing the error rate of our model as the number of trees increases.  \r\n```{r}\r\nplot(rfmodel, type=\"l\")\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
